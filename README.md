# KalmanFilterGuide
An Explanation how a Kalman Filter works.

This work was done during my studies at the RPTU Kaiserslautern. It demonstrates the effect of the different parameters of the Kalman Filter. The ipynb file can be modified to test different scenarios and the html file can be looked at to take a simple look at the research.
